# Detection of CAN Attacks Using Machine Learning

This project provides a **Machine Learning**-based solution for detecting attacks targeting the **CAN (Controller Area Network)** protocol used in autonomous vehicles. The application includes an interactive web interface to simulate attacks and predict their occurrence in real-time.

## üöÄ Features

- **Simulation of CAN attacks**: DoS, Fuzzy, and Impersonation.
- **Real-time prediction** powered by a Machine Learning model.
- **User-friendly interface** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Flask backend** to integrate the prediction model.
